# The key is 0600 and its directory is 0700, both root-owned, so an ordinary
# user cannot even stat it. That is the point, and it is also why the build does
# NOT simply run as root: `go build` under sudo writes a root-owned module and
# build cache into root's home, and the next ordinary build then fails on
# permissions in a way that takes an afternoon to understand.
#
# So the build runs as whoever invoked it, and exactly one step — the signature
# — elevates. If the key is readable without elevation (a key kept under the
# operator's own home, which is a perfectly reasonable choice), nothing
# elevates at all.

Install:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO/main/install.sh | sudo bash

Check it yourself, if you would rather not take the installer's word for it.
Download install.sh, SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.sig from this release, then:

    sed -n '/BEGIN PUBLIC KEY/,/END PUBLIC KEY/p' install.sh \\
      | sed -e 's/.*\\(-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\\)/\\1/' \\
            -e 's/\\(-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\\).*/\\1/' > holistic.pub.pem

    openssl pkeyutl -verify -pubin -inkey holistic.pub.pem \\
        -rawin -in SHA256SUMS -sigfile SHA256SUMS.sig

    sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS

The signature is Ed25519 over SHA256SUMS, and it needs pkeyutl rather than
dgst: openssl refuses an explicit digest with EdDSA operations.
