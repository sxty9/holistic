// Package cfauth builds the Cloudflare credential the setup process needs, and
// checks the one it is given.
//
// The automated path was investigated and declined, and the reason is worth
// recording so it is re-tested rather than re-argued. Cloudflare does now offer
// OAuth to third-party applications — self-service registration, PKCE, no
// client secret to ship — but consent selects an ACCOUNT, not a zone. On an
// account holding more than one zone, an OAuth grant of dns:edit is therefore
// WIDER than the hand-scoped token it would replace. The day Cloudflare adds
// zone-level scoping to the consent screen, this decision changes; until then,
// manual is not a compromise but the narrower option.
//
// What makes manual acceptable is that it does not have to mean transcription.
// Cloudflare documents template URLs that pre-fill the custom-token form, so
// the person reviews a form that is already correct and clicks Create. The four
// permission rows are precisely the step people get wrong and then over-grant
// out of frustration.
//
// Nothing here mints, stores or transmits a token. It builds a link and reads
// back what the person created.

// /user/tokens/verify hands back, and it is neither of the other two: the form
// says "Zone → DNS → Edit" and the API says "DNS Write".
//
// Matching on the name is a known weak point — Cloudflare documents the group
// ID as authoritative and the name as cosmetic, and the IDs cannot be known
// without asking the API for them. The failure mode is chosen deliberately: an
// unrecognised name reports the permission as missing and prints what the token
// actually carries, so the operator sees both lists and can tell it is a naming
// drift rather than a wrong token. A silent pass would be the alternative, and
// it would be worse.

// "Email Routing Addresses" permission is never needed. If a step ever needs a
// forward action, this list changes shape and the claim that it touches one
